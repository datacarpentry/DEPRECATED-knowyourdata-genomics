# Challenges for Knowing Your Data

## Downloading Data

## MD5

Compute the md5 checksum of example_file.txt.

In a text editor, add, delete, or substitute one character. Save the file and then re-compute the md5 checksum.

## File attributes

Your sequencing center sends you a link to data at `ftp://your.data.is.here/2015-03-24/smith001_R1.fastq.gz`. Before doing anything with it, describe four attributes of the file. Should you click on the link in your email? Why or why not?

Navigate to the `datadescription-genomics/data/sequences` directory. How many files are in the directory? What can you tell about the files from their names? Devise a shell commad that will tell you how many reads are in `01-09591_R1.fastq.gz`. Try your command on `01-09591_R2.fastq.gz`. Do you get the same number? Should you? 

Without opening the file or viewing it with `less`, determine the file type of `no_extension`

Determine whether `example.fasta` contains nucleotide or protein sequence.
